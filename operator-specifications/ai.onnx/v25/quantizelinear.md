The linear quantization operator consumes a high-precision tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the
low-precision/quantized tensor. The scale factor and zero point must have the same shape, determining the quantization
granularity. The quantization formula is `y = saturate((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point)`.

Saturation is done according to:
- uint16: [0, 65535]
- int16: [-32768, 32767]
- uint8: [0, 255]
- int8: [-128, 127]
- uint4: [0, 15]
- int4: [-8, 7]
- uint2: [0, 3]
- int2: [-2, 1]

For `(x / y_scale)`, it rounds to the nearest even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding for details.

`y_zero_point` and `y` must have the same type. `y_zero_point` is usually not used for quantization to float8 and 4bit types, but the quantization
formula remains the same for consistency, and the type of the attribute `y_zero_point` still determines the quantization type.
`x` and `y_scale` are allowed to have different types. The type of `y_scale` determines the precision of the division operation between `x` and
`y_scale`, unless the `precision` attribute is specified.

There are three supported quantization granularities, determined by the shape of `y_scale`.
In all cases, `y_zero_point` must have the same shape as `y_scale`.
- Per-tensor (per-layer) quantization: `y_scale` is a scalar.
- Per-axis quantization: The scale must be a 1-D tensor, with the length of the quantization axis. For an input shape
 `(D0, ..., Di, ..., Dn)` and `axis=i`, `y_scale` is a 1-D tensor of length `Di`.
- Blocked quantization: The scale's shape is identical to the input's shape, except for one dimension, in which
  blocking is performed. Given `x` shape `(D0, ..., Di, ..., Dn)`, `axis=i`, and block size `B`: `y_scale` shape is
  `(D0, ..., ceil(Di/B), ..., Dn)`.
