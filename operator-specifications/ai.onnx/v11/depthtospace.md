DepthToSpace rearranges (permutes) data from depth into blocks of spatial data.
This is the reverse transformation of SpaceToDepth. More specifically, this op outputs a copy of
the input tensor where values from the depth dimension are moved in spatial blocks to the height
and width dimensions. By default, `mode` = `DCR`.
In the DCR mode, elements along the depth dimension from the input tensor are rearranged in the
following order: depth, column, and then row. The output y is computed from the input x as below:

b, c, h, w = x.shape

tmp = np.reshape(x, [b, blocksize, blocksize, c // (blocksize**2), h, w])

tmp = np.transpose(tmp, [0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2])

y = np.reshape(tmp, [b, c // (blocksize**2), h * blocksize, w * blocksize])


In the CRD mode, elements along the depth dimension from the input tensor are rearranged in the
following order: column, row, and the depth. The output y is computed from the input x as below:

b, c, h, w = x.shape

tmp = np.reshape(x, [b, c // (blocksize ** 2), blocksize, blocksize, h, w])

tmp = np.transpose(tmp, [0, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3])

y = np.reshape(tmp, [b, c // (blocksize ** 2), h * blocksize, w * blocksize])
