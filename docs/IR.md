Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)
=========

ONNX is an open specification that consists of the following components:

1)  A definition of an extensible computation graph model

2)  Definitions of built-in operators and standard data types

__Notes on language in this and all related documents__:

1. The use of SHOULD, MUST, MAY and so on in this document is consistent with [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

2. The use of 'list' shall denote an ordered collection of items, 'set' shall denote an unordered collection of unique elements, and 'bag' an unordered collection of possibly non-unique elements.

Extensible computation graph model
----------------------------------

ONNX specifies the portable, serialized format of the computation graph. It may not be the form a framework chooses to use and manipulate. For example, a framework may keep the graph in memory in a format that it finds more efficient to manipulate for optimization passes. We make use of protobuf2 (with oneof, added in protobuf 2.6.1) for the serialized format.

### Model

The top-level container object in an ONNX model file is a ModelProto object that combines a computation graph with the following metadata properties.

#### Model Metadata

|Name|Type|Format|Description|
|----|----|------|-----------|
|ir_version|int64||The version of the IR format specification|
|opset_import|||Custom operator sets imported by the model|
|domain|string|Valid DNS name|A namespace for the model, following the style of package names, that is, reverse DNS domain name.|
|model_version|int64||The version of the model|
|producer_name|string||Name of framework/tool that generated this model|
|producer_version|string||Version of the framework/tool that generated this model|

Further metadata may be added to a model via its `metadata_props` field (as described further in the Extensibility section below).

### Graphs

Each computation dataflow graph is structured as a list of nodes that form a graph. These nodes MUST be free of cycles. Each node is a call to an operator. Nodes have one or more inputs, one or more outputs, and zero or more attribute-value pairs.

#### Model Graph Metadata

The following describes the metadata properties of a model graph:

|Name|Type|Format|Description|
|----|----|------|-----------|
|name|string|Valid C identifier|A name for the model.|
|doc_string|string|Free form|A human-readable documentation string intended to summarize the purpose of the model. Markdown is allowed.|

#### Names Within a Graph

Names are organized into separate namespaces, and must be unique within a namespace. The namespaces include the following:
 - `Node`: names that identify specific nodes in the graph, but not necessarily any particular input or output of the node.
 - `Graph`: names that identify graphs in the protobuf.
 - `Attribute`: names that identify attribute names for extra attributes that are passed to operators.
 - `Operator`: names that identify particular operators.
 - `Tensor`: names that identify intermediate tensor values flowing through the computation of a graph.

All names MUST adhere to C identifier syntax rules.

#### Nodes

Each computation node consists of a name, the identifier of the operator to be invoked, a list of named inputs and outputs, and a list of attribute-value pairs.

Edges in the computation graph are established by outputs of one node being referenced by name in the inputs of a subsequent node.

The list of nodes defining the top-level computation graph MUST be ordered topologically \- that is, if node K follows node N in the graph, none of the data inputs of N may refer to outputs of K, and no control input of N may refer to K.


Built-in Operators and Standard Data Types
------------------------------------------

### Operators

See the [operator documentation](Operators.md) for details.


### Standard data types

The following data types are supported by ONNX. Additional data types can be supported by frameworks.

|Group|Name|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|Floating Point Types|__float16, float32, float64__|Values adhering to the IEEE 754-2008 standard representation of floating-point data.|
|Signed Integer Types|__int8, int16,int32,int64__|Signed integers are supported for 8-64 bit widths.|
|Unsigned Integer Types|__uint8,uint16__| Unsigned integers of 8 or 16 bits are supported.|
|Complex Types|__complex64,complex128__|A complex number with either 32- or 64-bit real and imaginary parts.|
|Other|__string__|Strings represent textual data. All strings are encoded using UTF-8.|
|Other|__bool__|Boolean value represent data with only two values, typically _true_ and _false_.|
|Other|__handle__|Handles are opaque types holding a 64-bit integer.|
|Collections|__sparse and dense tensor__|Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices; whereas vectors have one dimension, and matrices two, tensors can have any number of dimensions, including zero. A zero-dimensional tensor is equivalent to a scalar.|

Extensibility
-------------

ONNX is expected to evolve over time and provides features that enable users to experiment and implement additions before they are added to the specifications.

### Metadata

A model allows named metadata strings to be added via its `metadata_props` field, typically for use by tools such as converters, indexers, or documentation generators. Names are not prescribed, but some name recommendations are provided for implementations that want to record such concepts.

- `author`: the name of the person(s) who authored the model
- `company`: the name of the company or organization that authored the model
- `converted_from`: if converted from a different format, the name of the source format or framework
- `license`: a human-readable name for a license, if applicable
- `license_url`: the URL where the license text is provided

### Operators

Operators may be extended via custom domain names in the `opset_import` field.
