## Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Any changes to the ONNX standard or related software should focus on solving a problem that users are having.
This section should explain this problem in detail, including necessary background.

It should also contain several specific use cases where this feature can help a user, and explain how it helps.
This can then be used to guide the design of the feature.

This section is one of the most important sections of any RFC, and can be lengthy.

## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it has already been accepted and this were part of the relevant user-facing documentation.
For operators they may typically mean the doc-string associated with the operator.
More generally (e.g., when proposing a large addition to the `onnx` Python package) this may include:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how downstream users should *think* about the feature. It should explain the impact on downstream use-cases as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.

## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features/operators is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented (here or downstream in case of a proposed operator).
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does a similar feature/operator exist in other projects?
- Is there an existing workaround that is commonly used?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects to provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the standard and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project and language in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
