Overview
========

Deep learning with neural networks is accomplished through computation
over dataflow graphs. Some frameworks such as CNTK, Caffe2, Theano, and
TensorFlow make use of static graphs while some like PyTorch and Chainer
use dynamic graphs. However, they all provide interfaces that make it
easier for developers to construct these computation graphs, and
runtimes that process the graphs in an optimized fashion. The graph
serves as an intermediate representation (IR) that captures the intent
of the developerâ€™s source code and is conducive for optimization and
translation to something that runs on specific devices (CPU, GPU, FPGA,
etc.).

Why a common IR?
----------------

Today each framework has its own proprietary representation of the
graph, though they all provide similar capabilities. This means each
framework is a siloed stack of API, graph, and runtime. Furthermore,
each framework has optimized for some characteristic such as fast
training, supporting complicated network architecture, inferencing 
on mobile devices, etc. Developers have to choose the characteristic 
that matters most to them and pick a framework. Many times, the 
characteristic most important during research and development is 
different than the one most important for shipping to production. 
This leads to significant delays between completion of development 
and start of shipping because the solution needs to be converted.

With the goal of democratizing AI, we envision developers being 
empowered to choose the framework that works best for the stage they 
are at and easily switching between frameworks as needed. We propose 
the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format as a common IR to help 
establish this powerful ecosystem.

By providing a common representation of the computation graph, ONNX 
helps developers choose the right framework for their task, framework 
authors to focus on innovative enhancements, and hardware vendors to 
streamline optimizations. 

ONNX is designed to be an open format.  We welcome contributions from the community and encourage everyone to adopt ONNX in their ecosystem.
