## Member Company logo on onnx.ai and other materials

Please follow this process to have your logo displayed:
1. Provide written permission indicating the logo can be used on the onnx.ai website as well as in presentations showing ONNX Member Companies
2. Provide a high quality logo file with transparent background

Member Companies may ask for their logo to be removed at any time and their status as Member Company rescinded. The Steering Committee also can vote to remove a Member Company of their status.
