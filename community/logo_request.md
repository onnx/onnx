## Member Company logos

Member Companies as defined [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/prasanthpul-patch-3/community#community-roles) can request their logo be displayed on https://onnx.ai and other materials.

Please follow this process to have your logo displayed:
1. Provide written permission indicating the logo can be used on the onnx.ai website as well as in presentations showing ONNX Member Companies
2. Provide a high quality logo file with transparent background
3. Submit a PR to https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee and attach your logo as a file in the "logos" directory

Member Companies may ask for their logo to be removed at any time and their status as Member Company rescinded. The Steering Committee also can vote to remove a Member Company of their status.
