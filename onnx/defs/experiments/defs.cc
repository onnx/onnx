The operator fills the elements of the output tensor with a constant value
specified by the 'value' argument.

The data type is specified by the 'dtype' argument. The 'dtype' argument must
be one of the data types specified in the 'DataType' enum field in the
TensorProto message. If the 'dtype' argument is not provided, the data type of
'value' is used.

The output tensor shape is specified by the 'shape' argument. If the number of
input is 1, the shape will be identical to that of the input at run time with
optional additional dimensions appended at the end as specified by 'extra_shape'
argument. In that case the 'shape' argument should not be set.

If input_as_shape is set to true, then the input should be a 1D tensor
containing the desired output shape (the dimensions specified in extra_shape
will also be appended)

NOTE: Currently, it supports data type of float, int32, int64, and bool.

Computes the result of passing an input vector X into a fully
connected layer with 2D weight matrix W and 1D bias vector b. That is,
the layer computes Y = X * W^T + b, where X has size (M x K),
W has size (N x K), b has size (N), and Y has size (M x N),
where M is often the batch size.
NOTE: X does not need to explicitly be a 2D vector; rather, it will be
coerced into one. For an arbitrary n-dimensional tensor
X \in [a_0, a_1, ...,a_{k-1}, a_k, ..., a_{n-1}] where a_i \in N+ and k is
the axis provided, then X will be coerced into a 2-dimensional tensor with
dimensions [a_0 * ... * a_{k-1}, a_k * ... * a_{n-1}]. For the default
case where axis=1, this means the X tensor will be coerced into a 2D tensor
of dimensions [a_0, a_1 * ... * a_{n-1}], where a_0 is often the batch size.
In this situation, we must have a_0 = M and a_1 * ... * a_{n-1} = K.
Lastly, even though b is a 1D vector of size N, it is copied/resized to
be size (M x N) implicitly and added to each vector in the batch.
Each of these dimensions must be matched correctly, or else the operator
will throw errors.

Run the input network in a recurrent fashion. This can be used to
implement fairly general recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
The operator proceeds as follows.
- First, initialized the states from the input recurrent states
- For each timestep T, apply the links (that map offsets from input/output
tensors into the inputs/outputs for the `step` network)
- Finally, alias the recurrent states to the specified output blobs.
This is a fairly special-case meta-operator, and so the implementation
is somewhat complex. It trades of generality (and frankly usability)
against performance and control (compared to e.g. TF
dynamic_rnn, Theano scan, etc).
See the usage examples for a flavor of how to use it.
